Quick designer tips (to pass at your meeting)

Use one short headline over images (large, bold) and the medium caption underneath — long blurbs live on the interior pages or “read more” toggles.

For gallery grids, use the short + medium pair only — visitors skim images quickly.

Keep consistent voice: confident, local, detail-oriented. Avoid jargon; lead with benefits (protected home, warranty, Sherwin-Williams, free in-person estimate). Competitors commonly highlight those things.
