        <p>Estimate → Prep → Paint → Clean → Warranty</p>
        <p>Transparent timeline and careful protection from day one to the final walkthrough.</p>
        <p>Every project begins with a free, in-person estimate and a clear scope of work. We protect floors and furniture, repair and prime surfaces, apply the right Sherwin-Williams products and finish with a meticulous clean and walkthrough. We stand behind our work with a workmanship warranty for your peace of mind.</p>

        <h3>Our Promise & Warranty</h3>
        <p>We stand behind our work with a clear, honest warranty and final walkthrough.</p>
        <p>Every job includes a workmanship warranty so you know we’ll return to address any issues that fall under our responsibility. We complete a final walkthrough with you to ensure the result meets your expectations.</p>

        <h3>Quality Materials</h3>
        <p>We use Sherwin-Williams premium paints.</p>
        <p>We specify Sherwin-Williams products because they offer excellent coverage, durability and color consistency. We match sheen and formulas to each room’s needs — from low-VOC options for occupied homes to tougher finishes for high-traffic areas.</p>
